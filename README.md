# OOSE-dots

This is assignment 1 for OOSE Fall 2016. It is the classic dots game (https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Games/dots&boxes.html).
This game is run on localhost:8080 and stores the data in a SQLite database.

Assignment information: http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose/assignments/assignment1.shtml

I ran this project by using eclipse. The included pom file should be able to build the necessary dependencies.
The Junit tests are in the src/test/... folder (it it called TestDotsServer.java).

Enjoy :)
